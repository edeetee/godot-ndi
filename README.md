> GDExtension for NDI®

[ NDI® is a registered trademark of Vizrt NDI AB ]

Licensed under MPL 2.0

The extension can **currently only receive video and audio**. Viewport output as NDI is planned. Extends the [VideoStream](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_videostream.html) and [VideoStreamPlayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_videostreamplayer.html) classes to implement NDI playback.

This is early stages. I'm happy to hear suggestions and incorperate improvements. [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/unvermuthet-gray?style=flat&logo=discord&logoColor=white&labelColor=%235865F2)](https://discord.com/users/203583245223198722)

## Example

```GDScript
extends Node

@onready var finder: NDIFinder = %NDIFinder
@onready var player: VideoStreamPlayer = %VideoStreamPlayer

func _ready() -> void:
    finder.connect("sources_changed", self.sources_changed)
    
func sources_changed():
    var sources := finder.get_sources()
    
    if not sources.is_empty():
        var source := sources.front() as VideoStreamNDI
        print(source.name)
        player.stream = source
        player.play()

```
